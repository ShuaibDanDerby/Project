        <!-- This is so Public speaking! -->
        When you hear the word fun what comes into mind, you probably think of having a good time and enjoying youself, but also with that you likely think; <em>good fun </em> or <em> bad fun</em>.
        <br>
        <dfn>Good fun</dfn>, its when you're having a good time without taking any high risks. 
        <br>
        But then aah! <dfn>bad fun</dfn>, thats the best fun you can have when everything is at stake and there is a propensity of things ending badly.
        But the feeling at that moment is quite unlike any other.<br>
        Adrenaline flows through your veins as you have the best time of your life.
        In a fleeting moment of ecstacy anything can go absolutely right or devastatingly wrong.
        And such is life, the psychotic villian <i> two face</i> would attest to the fact that 
        <q>life is like a coin toss</q>. <br>
        It may land on heads or maybe tails, its all down to probability
        and such unpredictibility of life is what makes it so precious.

        But today when I say FUN, I simply mean the band of muscians who play exquisite music.
        One of my favorites which is we are young.
        Incidentally the lyrics in this song remarkably describes a group of friends having this fun we are talking about today.
        He outlines some mistakes excessive fun caused to him and his friends but seems undeterred and ready to have more fun,
        as the girl he woes can always count on him if she feels overwhelmed by the immense amount of fu they're having.
